# Retail-Sales-Data-Analysis-Visualization
Overview: With thousands of daily transactions, retail companies need actionable insights into their product performance, customer behavior, and monthly trends. This project simulates the real work of a data analyst in a retail company. Your task is to build a Retail Sales Data Analysis & Visualization System using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. You'll work with a cleaned sales dataset to generate business insights, create visual dashboards, and export useful reports — helping management understand their sales dynamics and make data-driven decisions.
 Problem Statement:

1.Design a Python-based data analysis system that:

✅ Loads and processes real-world sales data using Pandas and NumPy
✅ Cleans missing values and corrects formatting for consistent analysis
2.Analyzes key business metrics like:

Most common payment methods
Cities with the highest order counts
Monthly growth in number of orders
3.✅ Identifies product-level patterns (like overpriced underperformers)

4.✅ Generates visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

5.✅ Exports clean, meaningful reports to share with business teams
